["Hello", "Hello there! How can I assist you with your physics learning today?", "How are you", "I'm here and ready to help with your physics questions! What would you like to learn about in physics today?", "I'm good.", "That's great to hear! When it comes to physics, is there a particular topic or concept you're currently exploring or curious about? Feel free to ask!", "Not really. Newton is my middle name.", "That's quite a \"forceful\" middle name! Since you're seemingly familiar with Newton, would you like to dive a bit deeper into his laws of motion, or explore other related concepts in classical mechanics? Perhaps there's a particular aspect you're curious about, like how these laws apply in real-world scenarios? Let me know how I can help advance your understanding!"]
